# SEES-Mosquito-Mapper-Research-Project
Members: Jessica Wu, Eric Choi, Eric Qian

For our project, we would like to figure out what type of land covers mosquito larvae are most present in by utilizing Collect Earth Online/Globe Observer and Python/Java. Peder recently demonstrated how all the Collect Earth Online data that is received by interns is automatically organized into csv sheets. Through using the Google Spreadsheet API, we would be able to code with Python and make multiple conclusions (Google Spreadsheet API Manual) and models that demonstrate the correlation of the occurrence of mosquito larvae  and various land covers.
